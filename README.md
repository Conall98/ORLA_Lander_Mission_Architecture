# ORLA_Lander_Mission_Architecture
Research Project 2023 repository. Databases and sizing calculations for low cost lunar transport mission architectures.
Hello, these are the excel files with the databases and sizing calculations I used for my research project. 
All of the data in the DBs are sourced in the files or in my report.
The two sizing calculator files: sizing calculator 2t.xlsx and sizing calculator max tons.xlsx Do two different things. the 2t case
sets the initial constraint to be the lunar lander payload at 2t and sizes the lander then the TV then the Launcher. The max tons sets the constraint as the maximum payload to LEO of the 
largest heavy lift launcher in service today: the Falcon Heavy, then sizes the TV then the Lander to find the maximum payload that 
could be placed on the moon.
